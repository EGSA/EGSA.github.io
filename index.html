					<h1 id="about">Who we are?</h1>
					<br/><br/>
					<p class="important">
						EGSA stands for Epic Grooveshark Assembly. We are a group of lovely people from several countries who have many things in common: musical taste, video games, nostalgia, a deep and abiding love for many things caffeinated...
						<br/><br/>
						EGSA was founded at some forgotten, informal date between July and October 2013 after Nikke (a.k.a. the Unperturbed) couldn't host his "VGM Music" broadcast. A splinter broadcast was established to keep the music coming and the chats flowing. Once Nikke was back, the group stayed together, some members floating back and forth, but most of us staying put. Currently EGSA celebrates its anniversary on August 15. 
						<br/><br/>
						We have between 30 and 40 “members” from several countries across North and South America, Europe, and Asia.
