h2. Drink one if:
* Drink one for every point below zero on a song
* You say goodbye after someone has already left
* People debate about the merits of a music genre (finish if you get angry)
* People debate about the merits of a video game genre (finish if you get angry)
* You miss the “eeeeeeeeee” on Popipo
* Someone suggests Bad Apple (both Japanese or English ver.).
* There is a LoL vs Dota debate (finish your drink if you are actively participating in said debate)
* Someone says “I don’t understand what you guys are talking about” or asks what an acronym means
* Miracle of Sound power hour
* Themecast (one per cast, not one per song; no fatalities on our watch!)
* “Hey, u guys ever herd of [some painfully common game, possibly slightly retro e.g. minecraft, Zelda]”
* “Huehuehue”, “gibe”, and other variations on Brazilian tropes
* You get a random follow (unless you are the BCer--then it’s a given, so no drink)
* Zephyr makes a pun (♥)
* NR tries to convince you he is evil (finish when he fails--cutie)
* Prowler makes a tpyo<-we’d all be hammered all the time
* If you’re multi-tabbing GS (always drunk)
* “Brb, meeting”
* Random joins and then immediately leaves or goes afk (or suddenly the whole bc goes afk.)
* Hueternet makes someone crash or lag out
* Nicolas Cage is your desktop background.
* Someone gets reported by Oni or CJ
* If you open any Heiko’s links (two if it’s SFW)
* If the song you are attempting to play has a problem and skips
* If the song that is suggested is obviously below 192kbps and plays suggester must drink? 
* You suggest a song thats already in the queue (Don’t underestimate Arashi’s playlists)
* Everyone in the BC refreshes the webpage 

h2. Finish your drink if:
* “Build That Wall”, “One-Winged Angel”, ”Still Alive”, or Darude’s “Sandstorm” in any form play
* Entire BC crashes 
* A random kid enters the chat and gets 100% ignored or banned.  Especially if they whine about it more than once.
* A new person looks like he’s 16 years old
* Someones talks about school (bannable offense--disagree; it’s a part of life for everyone; rules clarification may be needed; or asks for homework help, especially math)
* People debate which FF is best (correct answer is Final Fight)
* People debate which LoZ is best (correct answer is Zelda CDi)
* Nostalgic conversation about old-gen consoles
* “Well, I’m gonna get to [productive task].” *still chatting actively for another hour or more*
* Fray is going to play 2 or more sports in one day (have a glass of cola/water instead of your drink in his honor--virgin Cuba Libres for all!)
* You get semi-bloo (a.k.a. Guest)
* Get a banned member from another BC telling us how cool we all are and how we’re the new favorite

h2. Throw your drink and flip the table if:
* That one person inserts themself into every line of every conversation
* Aaron plays fapping hero (he’ll be in his bunk)
* Trooooooooooooll post (except for Fray)
* Spammer asks you to join their broadcast
* Random 12 year old girl enters broadcast and starts talking about her struggles with life, or math (really, aren’t they the same??).
