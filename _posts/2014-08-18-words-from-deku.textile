h2. Hi everyone!

What a great year was this, isn't it? Some making new friends, some sharing knowledge, playing games, falling in love ... and what is even greater is the fact that the Epic Grooveshark Assembly is 1 year old! I want to thank you for your friendship and wish we can be in contact for many years more.

I'm not a man of words, but code.

A biiiiiiig hug for everyone.

Bye!
Ciao!
Adieu!
Tchau!

PS: Sorry for bad english x)
